<p>What a crazy weekend! Unfortunately I haven't had time to update my blog posts! It's back to business now.  I've been working on finishing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWy2HlRDCRM">How to build a site with Umbraco - Part 1</a>
 tutorial by Paul Seal.  It took longer than I predicted attempting to troubleshoot Microsoft SQL Server on my laptop and the placement of the RenderBody() method in my base file.  I finally managed to fix these problems so tomorrow I'll continue with tutorial number 2!
