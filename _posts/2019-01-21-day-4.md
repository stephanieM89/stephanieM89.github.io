Started to learn the basics of Umbraco. Umbraco is a CMS(Content Management System) platform which allows developers to create websites tailor made for their customers/clients. The benefit of Umbraco is it's flexibility; it allows for separation between code and content management which makes Umbraco one of the most versatile CMS systems. My goal will be to create a simple website with Umbraco!
