<p>Today my goal was to add a comments system to my blog.  Github pages are generated
with Jekyll so there's no backend to run the comment engine.  After looking around, I found
a post on <a href="https://mademistakes.com/articles/jekyll-static-comments/">mademistakes.com</a> 
on using an external site <a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman</a> for working with Github pages comments.  Staticman lets you "bring user-generated content to static sites".  The great thing about Jekyll is that since it generates static sites, there is no backend code so sites are very fast.  The downside is that you cannot have lots of dynamic content.  With Staticman, your blog users can submit comments using an input form and Staticman will take that content and performs a Git commit.  This content can be pushed directly to GitHub pages or moderated through a pull request.</p>
