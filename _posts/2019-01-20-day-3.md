<p>Today was spent setting up the custom domain for this blog and attempting to connect to Staticman for the comments system.  The domain is now set up! Unfortunately was unable to connect Staticman to forms due to intermittent server load problems.  Have been added to the waiting list so hopefully this will be up and running in a few days time!
