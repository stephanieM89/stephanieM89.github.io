	<p>	I'm Stephanie, a graduate software developer from Glasgow, Scotland. </p>
	<p>
		My love for coding began a few years ago. I started by learning through youtube tutorials and decided that I wanted to commit to a change in career. At the time, I was a working as a locum optometrist but decided to take the plunge and embark on a completely different path. I recently completed my Masters degree in Software Development at Glasgow University and currently seeking a role in Java development.

		This year, I have decided to commit to the #100DaysOfCode challenge, with the my main goal of solidifying my habit of coding every day; to develop my coding skills and hopefully learn something new! My progress will be tracked through this blog and pushed to GitHub daily.

	<p>
		I started this blog to share my experiences, passions and learn.
